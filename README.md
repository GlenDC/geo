This mono repository contains everything related to the GEO project by [Plabayo](https://plabayo.tech).

- the books, all volumes: intended to teach you how to program in a bottoms up approach. In these books
  you'll get an introduction on all different layers of software (including an intro into hardware).
  In these books you'll see many different facets of software development and get taught along the way
  guidelines to help you throughout your future software carreer. While in your (future) job you will
  most likely not work on all the different kind of layers and types of project as introduced to you
  in these books, but it will however give you a broader understanding of the system as a whole,
  as well as let you taste of the variety in work you are able to choose to do.
   - The source codes of these books are freely available, and can be contributed to.
   - As the books are still early in progress no translations are accepted for now, this will change once
     in a far future the content of these books become stable enough.
   - You can if you choose to buy these books into a bundled form as a way to support the projects.
- This repository contains also all mini projects developed as part of the books;
- This repository contains also any other code developed in function of the books (e.g. examples);
- The red line throughout these books is an actual Gameboy (classic) emulator which can be played
  on any mainstream OS as well as directly in the browser. The gameboy emulator can also be used
  to play online with friends (one-to-one, as an online alternative to the Link Cable) as well as
  support for a variety of extra accessories that were made available over the years for this
  fantastic device.

Plabayo owns no rights to the Gameboy Classic and its original hardware design. As such this
repository contains no code proprietary to Nintendo. Neither do we distribute any ROMS (Games)
originally made for the Gameboy. Instead this mono repository contains also a custom
high level language (and extra's) that allow you to make a video game for this emulator yourself.

Any ROMS legally owned by you for the original Gameboy (classic) are also supported by this emulator
and you are allowed to use these for your own purposes for your own pleasure.
